A bridge between Student Information Systems and Google Apps

WARNING! The Google API used for this project is already depricated. Google will end support for these API's on April 20 2015.

Also, this is my first "real" python project, so don't expect it to look like it was written by a team of professional software developers.

Use at your own risk. If you do use this software I would love to hear about it. bradleyhilton@bradleyhilton.com

There are many things that still need to be done to make this work.

You need to have to Google Python Client Library installed (which is now depricated)
You need to have cx_Oracle installed to work with PowerSchool/Oracle
You need to have MySQLdb installed to work with MySQL


TO-DO:
	-- Add an empty DB DONE
	-- Add setup scripts
	-- Update to work with Google Admin SDK
	-- Switch DB to Postgres
